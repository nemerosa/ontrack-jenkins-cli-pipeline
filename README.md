# Ontrack CLI Jenkins Pipeline Library

Jenkins pipeline library using the [Ontrack](https://github.com/nemerosa/ontrack) GraphQL API.

## Installation

### JCasC

JCasC (Jenkins Configuration as Code) is the recommended approach:

```yaml
globalLibraries:
    libraries:
    - name: "ontrack-jenkins-cli-pipeline"
      retriever:
        modernSCM:
          scm:
            github:
              configuredByUrl: true
              credentialsId: "<GitHub credentials>"
              repositoryUrl: "https://github.com/nemerosa/ontrack-jenkins-cli-pipeline"
```

### UI

You can also use the Jenkins management UI to register this library:

![Library UI](docs/ontrack-jenkins-cli-pipeline-install-ui.png)

## Setup

The [steps](#steps) provided by this library, in order to avoid redundant configuration, rely on predefined environment variables and credentials.

> Those environment variables and credentials are not _strictly_ required but they will ease the use of the Ontrack steps.

In most of the cases, you just need to define:

* `ONTRACK_URL` - URL to Ontrack
* `ONTRACK_TOKEN` - secret text credentials entry containing the authentication token used to connect to Ontrack

See [`ontrackCliSetup`](vars/ontrackCliSetup.md) for more information.

## Usage

In your `Jenkinsfile`, declare the version of the pipeline library you want to use and start using the [steps](#steps) provided by the library. For example:

```groovy
@Library("ontrack-jenkins-cli-pipeline@main") _

pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage("Setup") {
            steps {
                // Ontrack connection & branch setup
                ontrackCliSetup()
            }
        }
        stage("Preparation") {
            steps {
                // Computing a version in VERSION
                // Ontrack build entry creation
                ontrackCliBuild(release: env.VERSION)
            }
            post {
                always {
                    // Validation run, including detection of the 
                    // status and run information
                    ontrackCliValidate(stamp: 'STAMP')
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Logging

Most of the [steps](#steps) accept a `logging` parameter but logging can be configured globally using the `ONTRACK_LOGGING` environment variable, set to `false` or `true` (`false` is the default).

> Note that any `logging` parameter on the step will override the global settings.

Typically, the `ONTRACK_LOGGING` environment variable would be set at pipeline level:

```groovy
pipeline {
    environment {
        ONTRACK_LOGGING = true
    }
}
```

### Versioning

In this example, we use the `main` branch of the pipeline library but it's better to stick to:

* versioned branches, like `v1`
* or explicit tags in order to ensure build reproducibility. See the list of available tags in [GitHub](https://github.com/nemerosa/ontrack-jenkins-cli-pipeline/tags).

## Steps

### General setup

* [`ontrackCliSetup`](vars/ontrackCliSetup.md) - general purpose setup task to set up Ontrack in your pipeline, from creating common environment variables to initializing project and branch in Ontrack for your pipeline.

### Creating Ontrack items

* [`ontrackCliBuild`](vars/ontrackCliBuild.md) - creates an Ontrack build entry based on current information
* [`ontrackCliValidate`](vars/ontrackCliValidate.md) - creates an Ontrack validation run for the current build, based on current information or provided information
* [`ontrackCliValidateTests`](vars/ontrackCliValidateTests.md) - creates an Ontrack validation run based on JUnit test results
* [`ontrackCliValidateCHML`](vars/ontrackCliValidateCHML.md) - creates an Ontrack validation run based on critical/high/medium/low stats
* [`ontrackCliValidatePercentage`](vars/ontrackCliValidatePercentage.md) - creates an Ontrack validation run based on a percentage
* [`ontrackCliValidateMetrics`](vars/ontrackCliValidateMetrics.md) - creates an Ontrack validation run based on a map of metrics

### Setting properties on builds

* [`ontrackCliBuildMessage`](vars/ontrackCliBuildMessage.md) - setting a message property on an existing build
* [`ontrackCliBuildMetaInfo`](vars/ontrackCliBuildMetaInfo.md) - setting or updating a meta-info property on an existing build

### Build links

* [`ontrackCliBuildLink`](vars/ontrackCliBuildLink.md) - creates a link to another build
* [`ontrackCliBuildLinks`](vars/ontrackCliBuildLinks.md) - creates several link other builds

### Accessing Ontrack information

* [`ontrackCliLastBranch`](vars/ontrackCliLastBranch.md) - getting the last branch for given pattern

### Auto versioning setup

* [`ontrackCliAutoVersioning`](vars/ontrackCliAutoVersioning.md) - setting up the auto versioning for the branch
* [`ontrackCliAutoVersioningCheck`](vars/ontrackCliAutoVersioningCheck.md) - checking the auto versioning alignment and creating a corresponding validation

### Generic steps

* [`ontrackCliGraphQL`](vars/ontrackCliGraphQL.md) - performs a GraphQL call to Ontrack and returns the JSON response

### CLI steps

Those steps allow to download and the setup the [Ontrack CLI](https://github.com/nemerosa/ontrack-cli).

* [`ontrackCliDownload`](vars/ontrackCliDownload.md) - downloads the [Ontrack CLI](https://github.com/nemerosa/ontrack-cli) and sets it into the path
* [`ontrackCliConnect`](vars/ontrackCliConnect.md) - creates a connection configuration for the Ontrack CLI, based on provided information or the environment
